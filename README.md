`pip install fqrweaveSDK`

<h2>Connect your wallet:</h2>


```
  from fqrweaveSDK import Fqrweave, Tools
  
  jwk_path = '/path/to/your/file.json'
  connect = Fqrweave(jwk_path)
  connect.login() # to keep your keyfile path connected in the current instance
  
```

<h2>Example:</h2>

after importing the package and get connected:
```
  generators_list = Tools().get_n_generators()
  print(generators_list)
```
This method, `.get_n_generators()` return a list of `jwk['n']` of verified generators. 

The actual number of generators is `len ( Tools().get_n_generators() - 1 )` because there is a wallet which belong to fQR Weave is added to the list in intention of testing.

You can anytime check how many generators fQR Weave have by calling this method. The scanner does not read any transaction generated by a wallet not included in this list.
